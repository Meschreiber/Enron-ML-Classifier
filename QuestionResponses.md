1. Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?  [relevant rubric items: “data exploration”, “outlier investigation”]

The goal of this project is to create a supervised classifier that takes in financial and e-mail data about Enron emplyees and classifies them as a person of interest ("POI") or not.  In order to accomplish this, we are supplied with two files: a pickled dataset "final_project_dataset.pkl" which includes 21 features on 146 Enron employees, and a hand-written list "poi_names.txt" of POI as researched by one of the instructors of this course, Katie Malone.  There are 35 people on this list, but only 18 of them appear in the dataset.  Effectively this list has been used to create one of the 21 features, "poi" which indicates whether the person is a POI or not.  Thus the dataset can be used for *supervised* learning since labels are available to help us train a classifier.  Some issues arise:

- 18 is a relatively small number of positives to train on, especially considering there are 35 of them and only approximately half are found in the dataset
- All of the features except for poi include NaN values. The number of NaNs in each feature is displayed below.
